# Web3-Based Voting Application

This is a web3-based voting application that operates using smart contracts created on the Polygon blockchain. The application is built with TypeScript, React, Javascript, HTML, CSS, and Solidity. The idea behind this application is to allow users to register and receive their votes, while preserving anonymity and ensuring security.

## Features
- Web3 and Web2 passwordless onboarding and authentication using email only authentication (magic link approach)
- Secure, non-custodial voting "wallet" where users can anonymously cast their votes
- Election results are traceable on the blockchain to ensure transparency of the election process
- Traceability of the total number of casted votes and total number of people who voted
- Strict access control to ensure that only users with access to their email addresses can gain access to the non-custodial voting wallets
